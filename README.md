HYBRID ONTOLOGY EXTRACTION FROM RESEARCH PAPERS

The main idea is to avoid the labor intensive task accompanied with higher time consumption for manual extraction of terminologies from research papers and combining them with the exisiting ontology. Likewise with free LLM, the chance of halllucination and repetition is high so, we attempted for a hybrid system the accounts both the positive features overcoming the exisiitng challenges in data consistency, semantic understanding.
